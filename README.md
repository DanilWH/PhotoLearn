# PhotoLearn
Another spring web application. This application is designed for teachers to
teach students new thing about photos editing. This project was given to me by
one of my teachers of my college.

Available on: [photo-learn.herokuapp.com](https://photo-learn.herokuapp.com/)

What I've learned:
 - Any transfer of data between the client and server should be done through DTO models.
