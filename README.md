# PhotoLearn
Another spring web application. This application is designed for teachers to
teach students new thing about photos editing. This project was given to me by
one of my teachers of my college.

Available on: [photo-learn.herokuapp.com](https://photo-learn.herokuapp.com/) (getting to the site may take some time.)

What I've learned:
 - Any transfer of data between the client and server should be done through DTO models.
 - It's not a good practice to write logic in controllers. Rather, create a new service and some methods in it. Those methods should do the logic.
